## About The BrainGrid Project

The idea behind The BrainGrid Project is to develop a toolkit/software architecture to ease creating high-performance neural network simulators. It is particularly focused on facilitating biologically realistic modeling. 

Our current focus is on single-threaded simulators and simulators running on GPUs using NVIDIA's CUDA libraries. We expect to shortly thereafter roll out support for multi-cluster CPU and multi-threading using OpenMP. 

##### Multiple simulation architectures:

- Single-threaded on general-purpose CPU
- GPU-accelerated using NVIDIA's CUDA libraries
- Multi-cluster (CPU version) *— under development*
- Multi-threading using OpenMP — *not yet implemented*

##### Supported operating systems:

-  Linux Distribution
